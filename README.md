# tasktrack
Set a time amount to complete a programming task.

While Pyglet is a heavy program, I was learning to code and
ended up using it.  Perhaps the program could be re-written
using a lighter package.


!!!!!!!!  PLEASE NOTE
  
  The pyglet package has two changed lines, noted at the top of the gui.py file.  This was done to handle the error "Canvas not attached."
  They add a flag.
